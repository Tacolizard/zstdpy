# zstdpy
A python command line program to compress files with the revolutionary Zstandard compression algorithm.

Zstandard is exceptionally fast, yet still capable of very impressive compression ratios.
Zstandard is also one of the best algorithms for small file compression, able to compress files even in the tens of bytes range.
